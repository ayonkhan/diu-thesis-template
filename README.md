# LaTeX thesis template for DIU (Unofficial)

This is an unofficial LaTeX (pronounced either "Lah-tech" or "Lay-tech") thesis template for the students of [Daffodil International University](https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/) (DIU).

## How to Use

You can install a LaTeX distribution such as [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/), [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) on your computer, and then import the files.

However, I would suggest an online editor like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or [Papeeria](https://www.papeeria.com/) if you are new to LaTeX. You should also check out these books.
